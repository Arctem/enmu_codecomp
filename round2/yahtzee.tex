\title{Decoding Messages}

You have intercepted a number of transmissions from the Evil Empire of Evilness. Though you have been able to translate much of the text, they are using a clever cipher to disguise their numbers. Unless you are able to decode these numbers, there is no way to properly sabotage the Empire's plans!

Each Imperial Cipher consists of 5 integers, ranging from 1 to 6. You must convert each group of numbers into the value it represents, using one of the following rules:

\begin{tabular}{| r | l |}
  Number Pattern & Example & Value\\\hline
  Five of one number & 4 4 4 4 4 & 50\\\hline
  Four of one number & 3 1 3 3 3 & Sum of all values\\\hline
  Three of one number & 6 1 6 6 4 & Sum of all values\\\hline
  Three of one number, two of another number & 3 3 5 3 5 & 25\\\hline
  Five sequential values & 4 5 3 1 2 & 40\\\hline
  Four sequential values & 6 3 4 1 5 & 30\\\hline
  Any numbers & 2 2 1 5 6 & Sum of all values\\\hline
\end{tabular}

Note that order does not matter for any pattern.

In the case where the set of integers would fulfill multiple of these patterns, the largest possible value is chosen.

Input will be space-separated 5 integers, ranging from 1 to 6. Output will be the value those integers represent. An input of \verb{0} will indicate end of input.

Sample:
2 4 1 3 5

6 6 5 5 6
