  It's hard keeping track of what is and isn't your fault when
  traveling through time...or talking to women.

\section*{Description}
As per the Code of Ethics of Time Travel, one must be careful with any
changes that are made. When you're lazy, like Seymore, paying
attention to all those silly effects (avalanche, domino, butterfly) is
just too much effort so why not just do whatever and apologize when
things go wrong later! What's the saying? It's easier to get
forgiveness than attention?

Your task is potentially catastrophic --- given a list of chain reactions resulting
from something Seymore did (event A) and a worrying end case,
determine if the end event was Mr. Traveler's fault so he can send
back apology flowers.

\section*{Example Input/Output}
You will be given a variable number of lines consisting of upper-case
letters. The first letter of each line is the causing event and each
letter following it is a resulting effect. The last line in the
list will have a single letter. You must determine if this event
(letter) was caused by Mr. Traveler (event A). It will always be a
directed acyclic graph.
