\title{The Lazy Time Traveler}

\begin{flavor}
  True laziness is achieved when one spends more effort avoiding work
  than the work would have taken in the first place.
\end{flavor}

\section*{Description}
A very lazy time traveler lives on the equator of the Earth. Like many
time travelers, he loves to travel! Paris, Cairo, Disney World --- it
would be a waste to only explore different times! Unfortunately,
our Mr. Time Traveler suffers from crippling laziness. Lucky for him, his
time machine can help! If he simply travels in time, and lets the
Earth rotate underneath his time machine, he can force places to come
to him --- brilliant!

Your task is simple --- given a starting location (in degrees), and a
desired ending location (again, in degrees), calculate how long the
time traveler will need to travel in time to arrive at his
destination. Remember, the Earth spins $360^\circ$ every 24 hours.

\section*{Example Input/Output}

You will be given a starting location $s \in [0, 360]$ and an ending
location $e \in [0, 360]$, separated by spaces. You must
output a time, in hours between -12 and 12.

\begin{example}
0 360
|\textbf{0.0}|

320 200
|\textbf{-8.0}\end{example}\end{document}
