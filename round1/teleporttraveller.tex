\title{Shoots and SPACE-LADDERS}

\begin{flavor}
  While exploring the future, Seymore Time Traveler discovered a new
  technology --- FUTER-SPACE-PORTAL technology\ldots thing!
\end{flavor}

\section*{Description}
Our hero, again, is in a predicament of laziness. He has discovered
many world, connected together by \emph{SPACE WORMHOLE THINGS}! He
would love to travel through them\ldots but he doesn't want to travel
through \emph{too} many wormholes (because that sounds hard).

Your task, should you choose to accept it, is to find the shortest
path from the starting world, to the destination of Seymore's choice.

\section*{Example Input/Output}

You will be given $n+1$ lines of input, where $n$ is the number of
worlds. Each of the first $n$ lines will be a world name (a single
upper-case character), followed by a list of each world \emph{that}
world has a portal to. The $n+1$'th line will be a single upper-case
letter, designating the desired destination. You must output a
sequence of letters that represents the shortest path to the
destination. Assume you start at the first given world. You can assume
a path will always exist. There will be less than 10 worlds given.
